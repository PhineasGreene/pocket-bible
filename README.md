# Pocket Bible
The goal of this project is to go from the 4361566 byte ASCII King James Bible (kjv.bible) to something much much smaller.
## Compressed Bibles
I haven't even scraped tiny yet. See individual READMEs for more. Ratio is `Original Size / (Compressed Size + Decompressor Size).
| Bible | Compressed Size | Decompressor Size | Ratio |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
|6-Bit  | 3147819 bytes   | 16512 bytes       | 1.38  |
|ASCII  | 4361566 bytes   | 0 bytes           | 1     |
